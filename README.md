# E-Commerce Sales Reporting System

This is a beginner-friendly project that creates a simple SQL-based reporting system for an e-commerce store.

##  Features
- SQL schema with `customers`, `products`, `orders`, and `order_items`
- Python script to generate revenue reports from SQL queries
- Exports data to Excel using `pandas`

##  Tech Stack
- SQLite
- Python (sqlite3, pandas, openpyxl)


##  Project Overview

This project simulates a mini e-commerce analytics system that integrates database design, SQL queries, and Python-based reporting.
It demonstrates the end-to-end data workflow — from setting up a relational database to extracting insights and generating an automated sales report.

The final output is an Excel report (sales_report.xlsx) that shows total revenue per product.

├── report.py         # Script to generate sales report
├── schema.sql        # Database schema (tables)
├── seed_data.sql     # Sample data for customers, products, and orders
├── ecommerce.db      # SQLite database (auto-created when running init_db.py)
├── sales_report.xlsx # Generated Excel report (output)

##  Setup Instructions

Clone the repository
https://github.com/6303-naidu/ecommerce-sales-report.git
cd ecommerce-sales-report

Install dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then install required libraries:

pip install pandas openpyxl
Initialize the database
python init_db.py
This will create ecommerce.db using schema.sql and populate it with seed_data.sql.
Generate the sales report
python report.py
The script will create sales_report.xlsx containing revenue by product.

##  How It Works

Database Creation (init_db.py)
Connects to SQLite and runs schema.sql to define tables:
customers, products, orders, order_items
Loads sample records from seed_data.sql
Data Analysis (report.py)

# Runs an SQL query:

SELECT p.name AS product_name, 
       SUM(oi.quantity * p.price) AS total_revenue
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY p.name;


# Fetches results with Pandas
Saves the report into Excel (sales_report.xlsx)

## Example Output
sales_report.xlsx

product_name	    total_revenue
Laptop	           800.00
Headphones	    300.00
##  Results
Successfully built an end-to-end data pipeline for e-commerce analytics.
Automated generation of Excel sales reports for revenue insights.
